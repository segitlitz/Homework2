Matching causes you to lose a lot of data
Weighting allows you to keep all the data points 
When Di=1 then Yi=Y1
We are going to divide by probability of being treated
If someone is treated but they have a high probability of treatment, they will be weighted less
If someone is treated but they had a low probability of treatment, they will be weighted more 

Exact matching: finding counties with the exact same number of Medicare eligible (exact=true)
